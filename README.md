# Bill-Splitter

Bill-Splitter is a simple Python script to split bills among friends or participants equally. It calculates the amount each person needs to pay or receive to settle the bills.

## Features

- **Equal Split Calculation**: Divides the total bill amount equally among participants.
- **Custom Split**: Supports custom weights for participants if the split isn't equal.
- **Input Flexibility**: Handles various input formats for ease of use.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VIKASADODARIYA/Bill-Splitter.git
   ```

## Usage

1. Enter the total bill amount.
2. Enter the number of participants.
3. Follow the prompts to enter individual names and their respective paid amounts.
4. The script will calculate and display how much each participant owes or is owed.

## Example

Suppose you have a bill of $100 and there are 3 participants:
- Participant A paid $40
- Participant B paid $30
- Participant C paid $30

Running the script with these inputs would output:
```
Total bill amount: $100
Number of participants: 3

Participant A owes $10.00
Participant B is settled (owes $0.00)
Participant C is settled (owes $0.00)
```
